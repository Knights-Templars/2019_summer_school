    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous sessions have seen techniques aimed at determining the underlying P.D.F. from which the observed data are sampled (using either parametric or nonparametric models). **Regression** aims instead at inferring the expectation value of the dependent variable $y$ given the independent variable $x$ (i.e., the conditional expectation value).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the most generic form, we want to parametrize the function $f$ defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = f (x | θ) ~~~~~~ (1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where **θ** is a set (array) of $k$ parameters: $θ_p$ , p = 1, . . . , $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example when we think of fitting a straight line we are assuming:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_i = θ_0 + θ_1 x_i ~~~~~~ (2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Just to avoid confusion, let's clarify that we are talking about $linear$ regression when the function $f$ is linear with respect to the parameters, not with respect to the variable $x$! For example, the function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f (x|θ ) = \\sum^k_{p=1} θ_p g_p(x) = θ_1 g_1(x) + θ_2 g_2(x)~+~...~+~θ_k g_k(x) ~~~~~~ (3) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "describes a linear problem as long as the sub-functions $g_p(x)$ do not depend on any of the parameters $θ_p$. \n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: The function described in Equation 3 does $not$ represent the most generic formulation of linear regression: it is just the form we will adopt in the reminder. An other example of suitable linear regression function is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f (x|θ ) = θ_1 g^2(x) + θ_2 g(x)h(x) + θ_2 h^2(x) ~~~~~~ (4) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "i.e. the important property is to be linear in $θ_p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. Why machine learning regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, we would like to use a theoretically-derived funtion which could describe the observed distribution of the data. By fitting its parameters to the data we could simply preform the regression (we have seen this e.g. in the Bayesian session). However this is not always possible because e.g. we might be facing a new problem or because we are simply not satisfied by the available options in the literature. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even if we do not know the intrinsic form, we can still mimic any function by using a model $f (x|θ )$ composed of an arbitrary number of sub-functions, just like in Equation 3. One common approach is to use \"Basis Functions\", i.e. expand $f(x)$ over a _specific_ \"family\" of functions $g_p(x)$, for example a series of Gaussians with different means and variances.\n",
    "\n",
    "How many functions do we need? We do cannot decide that a priori. The more functions we use, the better the model will fit the data, but the number of parameters increases (i.e. the size of $θ_p$) and so does the risk overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "That is why we need some techniques to dinamically constrain the model."

    "\n",
    "In previous classes we saw that the best-linear regression parameters set **θ** can be found by minimizing the $\\chi^2$. In machine learning jargon, $\\chi^2$ is a type of cost function (negative likelihood is one of the possible cost functions). When the error bars are the same size (homoscedastic data), then the cost function can be expressed as the $L2$ norm: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$min~||~y - f (x | θ)~||^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we also saw that the risk of over-fitting is always lurking behind the corner when the fit parameters are way too many.\n",
    "In the case of the the expansion of $f$ as $\\sum^k_{p=1} θ_p g_p(x)$, too many parameters translates into the idea that we are trying to use too many base functions $g_p(x)$, so that several of them might be redundant or cancel out.\n",
