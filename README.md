# Project Title

Notebooks from the teaching sessions and the workshops of the
[2019 Summer School for Astrostatistics in Crete](
https://astro.physics.uoc.gr/Conferences/Astrostatistics_School_Crete_2019)

## Getting Started

The repository is organized in one folder per subject.
You will have to download the notebooks as well as the data
(which are on an other server).
See "Installing" below.

### Prerequisites 

```
Python v3.6
Jupyter notebook
```
Instruction on retrieveing Jupyter notebook here: https://jupyter.org

### Installing

First download or clone this repository on your machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/astrostatistics-in-crete/2019_summer_school.git
```

Then download the data. 
From within the repository folder, run:

```
python get_data.py
```
This will automatically create the "data" subfolders within each 
subject folder, and download the data.
It will also try to run jupyter notebook: ignore that. 

## Running the notebooks

```
jupyter-notebook <notebook_name>.ipynb
```
